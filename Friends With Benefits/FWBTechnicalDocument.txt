===================================

Pixel Perfect Stuff
-------------------
-target screen resolution is 960 x 540 px with pixel block size being 16x16
-sprites are imported at 160 pixels per unit
-orthographic camera size is set to 1.6875 => 160 = (540/(screenRes * 2))
-the ProGrids plugin greatly helps with snapping and positioning tiles
-to enable ProGrids go to Tools/ProGrids/ProGrids Window
-change the ProGrids snap settings to 0.05 units (this equals 8 pixels in the game world)
-each sprite should use the "BaseSpriteMaterial" material if not using a custom material



Level Building
--------------
-levels should have a root level object where all other objects (level tiles, collision volumes, etc) are parented
-each root level object should have a "LevelManager" component attached
-each type of level object should have its own parent as well so the level stays organized
-place tiles for level layout
-buffer tiles should be place outside of camera to account for screen shake
-once level tiles are placed you can start manually setting collision volumes
-resize collision volumes using the BoxCollider2D Size settings rather than scaling the game object
-it's important that collision volumes are flush along the x-axis, meaning that for each continuous horizontal platform there should be one solid collision
-set collision volume layers to "Obstacle"
-when level layout is complete you should add 4 spawn points (just empty game objects); the spawn points need to be added to the "LevelManager" spawn points array in the inspector
-a finished level should have a heirarchy like the following:
	-LevelRoot
		-Tiles
			-Tile01
			-Tile02
			-Tile03
			-etc...
		-CollisionVolumes
			-CollisionVolume01
			-CollisionVolume02
			-CollisionVolume03
			-etc...
		-Props
			-Prop01
			-Prop02
			-Prop03
			-etc...
		-SpawnPoints
			-SpawnPoint01
			-SpawnPoint02
			-SpawnPoint03
			-SpawnPoint04
-when level is totally finished it should be added to "Assets/Resources/Levels"
